            <td colspan="6"><article><p>The Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) Friday released the revamped draft data protection Bill, three months after withdrawing a previous version that had alarmed big technology companies and the civil society.
                <br><br>
            The new Bill now being called the Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, 2022, has provisions on ‘purpose limitations’ around data collection, grounds for collecting and processing personal data, relaxation on cross-border data flows, and imposes significant penalties on businesses for violating provisions of the Bill.
            <br><br>
            The new measure is up for public consultation until December 17, and the final version is expected to be tabled in the Budget session of Parliament next year.
            <br><br>
            The proposed legislation offers significant concessions on cross-border data flows, in a departure from the previous Bill’s contentious requirement of local storage of data within India’s geography. According to the new draft, the Centre will notify regions to which data of Indians can be transferred. Sources said the conditions for selecting such regions would be based on its data security landscape and if the government can access data of Indians from there.</p></article></td>
